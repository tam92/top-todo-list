# top-todo-list
This is my take on the project "To-Do List", from The Odin Project.

## Objectives/Features

- When a user first opens the app, there is a default project to
  which all of their todos are put.

- Users can create new projects and choose which project their
  togos go into.

- The To-Dos have projects or separate lists of to-dos.

### User interface

- Capable of viewing all projects.
- View all todos in each project (just title and due-date, and changing colors 
for different priorities).
- Expand a todo item, and see/edit its contents.
- Delete a todo.
- Delete a project.

## What I used

- Vanilla JavaScript
- CSS
- JSON
- [Web Storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API/Using_the_Web_Storage_API)

### Webpack
- Installed packages:
  - webpack 
  - webpack-cli
  - [date-fns](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns)
